# F2 Charm 4 EIC

## Quick setup

- Run the install script: 
  ```
  ./install
  ```
  This will compile the fortran codes 
  and it will generate the wrapper.

- Run the driver script:
  ```
  ./driver.py
  ```

- If everything goes well a folder called "gallery" 
  will be created with a pdf plot

## Trouble shooting

- Failure in the install script. Create an issue 
  in github

- Failure in the driver.py. Try commenting out 
  lines 6-8 using the # simbol. If it does not work 
  create an issue.
